      <h3>Futureproofing Health</h3>
      <p class="meta">Center for Climate and Health · Global</p>
      <p>
        I support the development of an international cohort of PhD students from seven countries,
        building a network focused on climate and health in disaster contexts.
        My contributions include assessments of government and community drought responses across southern Africa,
        drawing from national newspapers, government records, and community perspectives.

      <p>
