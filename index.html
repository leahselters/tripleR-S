      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Resilience and Refuge Research Services</strong> is a
        research consulting group focused on the intersections of
        <strong>climate change, displacement, and mobility</strong>.
        We collaborate with NGOs, researchers, and policymakers to generate
        rigorous, grounded insights that support more just and effective
        responses to climate-related migration and forced displacement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work bridges qualitative and quantitative methods, centering
        the lived experiences of affected communities while remaining
        accountable to partners’ practical needs and timelines.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Climate-Induced Displacement Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          A mixed-methods project examining how slow-onset climate impacts
          (drought, sea-level rise, ecosystem degradation) shape patterns of
          mobility and immobility. We work with partners to co-develop
          indicators, visualize spatial data, and contextualize quantitative
          trends with qualitative insights.
        </p>

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Urban Refuge & Informal Settlements</h3>
        <p>
          Qualitative research with displaced communities in urban and
          peri-urban settings, focusing on housing precarity, access to
          services, and everyday strategies of resilience. Outputs include
          policy briefs, workshop facilitation, and co-authored reports with
          local organizations.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Collaborative Research Design Support</h3>
        <p>
          Advisory support for research teams designing projects on climate,
          migration, and displacement. This can include refining research
          questions, methods selection, ethical protocols, and participatory
          approaches that meaningfully involve affected communities.
